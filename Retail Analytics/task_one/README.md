Quantium Virtual Internship — Retail Strategy and Analytics (Task 1)
Project Overview
This repository contains my comprehensive analysis for Task 1 of the Quantium Virtual Internship — Retail Strategy and Analytics. The project involves deep-diving into transactional retail data to extract actionable insights through customer segmentation, product-level analysis, basket size and frequency assessment, and time-series trend analysis.
